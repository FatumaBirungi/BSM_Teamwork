<h1> Teamwork BSM</h1>
<p> Teamwork to us is a combined action of group of people,especially when effective and efficient,
    <em>My team  has a good sense of teamwork am so greatfull</em> about my chosen BSM because its always been 
    challenging working by myself but with Teamwork Its been easy and  important for organizations, especially in 
    todayâ€™s highly digital world. Studies show that organizations that 
    emphasize teamwork innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly,
     find better solutions to problems, and attain higher productivity.

     <p>
         Improving teamwork aims to increase class productivity and performance for 
          the benefit of the organization. For example, salespeople thrive on healthy
           competition, but they close more deals, and the organization benefits when they work as a team.
